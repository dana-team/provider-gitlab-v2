        description: 'The gitlab_branch_protection resource allows to manage the lifecycle of a protected branch of a repository. ~> Branch Protection Behavior for the default branch Depending on the GitLab instance, group or project setting the default branch of a project is created automatically by GitLab behind the scenes. Due to some https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/terraform-provider-gitlab/issues/792 limitations https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/ignore-the-order-of-a-complex-typed-list/42242 in the Terraform Provider SDK and the GitLab API, when creating a new project and trying to manage the branch protection setting for its default branch the gitlab_branch_protection resource will automatically take ownership of the default branch without an explicit import by unprotecting and properly protecting it again. Having multiple gitlab_branch_protection resources for the same project and default branch will result in them overriding each other - make sure to only have a single one. This behavior might change in the future. ~> The allowed_to_push, allowed_to_merge, allowed_to_unprotect, unprotect_access_level and code_owner_approval_required attributes require a GitLab Enterprise instance.

Since this default branch protection is not currently managed via Terraform, to workaround this limitation, you can remove the default branch protection via the API and create your desired Terraform managed branch protection. In the gitlab_project resource, define a local-exec provisioner which invokes the /projects/:id/protected_branches/:name API via curl to delete the branch protection on the default branch using a DELETE request. Then define the desired branch protection using the gitlab_branch_protection resource. Upstream API: GitLab REST API docs https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/api/projects/'

Therefore, this resource queues every call to the repository files API no matter of the project, which may slow down the terraform execution time for some configurations.
